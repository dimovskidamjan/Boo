**Boo is an open source macOS app built with Swift.** Its sole purpose in life is to make yours easier.

If you're tired of typing the same command in Terminal over and over again just to show or hide your hidden files, Boo is the tool for you! It sits quietly in your menu bar and awaits your command from the moment you start your Mac until you tell it to go away.

## Installation

If you want to install Boo, [download it](http://bit.ly/2yokbkv), mount it, and follow the instructions.

## Contributions
Originally, this was supposed to be my first macOS app on the App Store, under the working title Ghost. But, as many of you will no doubt know, macOS apps are requested to run in a Sandbox, and are not allowed to edit user preferences or give commands to other apps or processes. Long story short, I was rejected within 30 minutes of submission, and decided to open source my app.

So feel free to fork, branch, and contribute in any way you want. I will try to address all issues which will be opened, but please bear in mind that this was a tool made to do one job and one job only, and it does just that.

## Author
Boo was developed by Damjan Dimovski, in a couple of hours of boredom. For more, please check out [dimovskiapps.com](http://dimovskiapps.com) to see my other apps.
